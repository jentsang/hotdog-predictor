    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we used decision trees, logistic regression, and a Naive Bayes classifier to identify whether or not a food vendor sells hot dogs via their name. We trained each model individually using a cross-validation setup, and we compared the scores of the accuracy in order to determine a model to train and to compare to the test data. The model we chose, finally, was the Naive Bayes, as it provided a slightly better score and less underfit and overfit than the other models present. Finally, we validated it with our test data and came to the conclusion that even though it is good enough for classifying most of the cases, it still struggles discerning from the minority class, which in our case, is our target."

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Food trucks and mobile food vendors are a common sight in Downtown Vancouver, offering a wide range of cuisine types from hot dogs and burgers to shawarma and tacos. With so many different vendors and food options, it can be useful to automatically identify what kind of food a vendor specializes in based only on select information. In this project, we study whether we can predict if a food vendor is a hot dog vendor or not using the vendor’s business name. We used a publicly available dataset of mobile food vendors in Vancouver from the City of Vancouver’s open data portal, where each row represents relevant information for a single food vendor and includes columns such as BUSINESS_NAME, LOCATION, DESCRIPTION, GEO_LOCALAREA, and geographic coordinates. For our analysis, we constructed a binary target variable named is_hotdog, which is True when the DESCRIPTION is “Hot Dogs” and False otherwise. This allows us to investigate how much information about the type of food a vendor sells can be extracted from the business name, as well as putting to test the prediction power of some of the most common classification algorithms: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Naïve-Bayes."

Majority of the columns in our data frame will be dropped as they are not relevant to our project so we have assigned them to be `nullable=True` in the column constuctor meaning that we'll allow missing values in these unimportant columns. One of the crucial columns in our analysis is the `DESCRIPTION`  column as this is the column that our target variable is based off of, so missing values in this column need to be flagged. The above check looks to make sure that **both** `BUSINESS_NAME` and `DESCRIPTION` arent misssing in the same row while check 4 makes sure that the `DESCRPTION` column in particular doesnt contain missing values."

The majority of the columns aren't useful to us in our analysis so if they have null values we dont really care as they'll be dropped in the preprocessing stage anyways and the one critical column (`DESCRIPTION`) has no leeway to have any missing values at all so if any missing values are present the row is dropped and a threshold isn't necessary.\n",

    "In summary, when visualizing our EDA we can notice several key points. In the first plot we can see that of all the cuisine types from Downtown Vancouver food vendors, hot dog stands seem to be the most common of them all. It is also very important to analyze our classes before starting our work. When you have a large class imbalance, a lot of the times your model will give you a score that is not representative of whether or not your model works well. For example, if you observe the second plot for a data set where one class is represented in a much higher proportion than the other, a model like DummyClassifier will give you an extremely high score. This isn't because the model works perfectly it's because it'll always predict the higher represented class! Yet we can see that we do not have that issue as much here as the class imbalance isn't too skewed. Finally, we would expect for our classifier to be able to identify the \"easy\" base case of having no name, since this is a relevant discriminator for both our classes."

    "For this analysis we will implement a `CountVectorizer` object to create a bag of words (BOW). This method will split each individual word in the names of the businesses into its own individual columns, and will assess whether or not the word is present in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then pass this `CountVectorizer` into a pipeline with the different models we want to test:\n",
    "- `DummyClassifier`: This will be our baseline to check on how we will predict whether or not the vendor sells hot dogs or not.\n",
    "- `DecisionTreeClassifier`: This simple model will help us identify if simple decisions map out the relationship of the names to the category.\n",
    "- `LogisticRegression`: This model will help us identify if there are linear relationships in the model, and which tokens are more relevant for our classification.\n",
    "- `BernoulliNB` (Naïve-Bayes): This model is quick to fit and train, and uses a probabilistic approach to the classification, and it would be interesting to see how it fares in comparison to the rest of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "After performing the evaluation for each model, we will compare them all together and train the best one, optimising its hyperparameters. We will score based on the model **accuracy** (correct predictions over total predictions), as this is just a simple experiment to validate the relationship of these 2 variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the best model, we will take a peek on how it performs on the test data, and evaluate our conclusions."

    "\n",
    "We compared the performance of 4 different models (Dummy, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Naive-Bayes), and we proceeded with Naive-Bayes, therefore, we chose Naive-Bayes to move forward with hyperparameter tuning. We used RandomizedSearchCV to identify the best hyperparameter values for Max Features and alpha, and evaluated the best model with the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw, there are several limitations to what a count vectorizer and a binary classification can perform. The relationships that we found within our variables are probably not linear, as there are some cases where the biases of our more intelligent classifiers, such as the Bayesian and the logistic regression, would favor into classifying something as not hotdog, when we noticed from our EDA that it was those specific cases of no name where the model should have predicted that that was hotdog stand. This makes for a model that will be particularly good at identifying the majority class, which pretty much makes it comparable to a dummy. And thus, we observed the limitations of of our current estimators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, depending on the context of our problem, we may lean in favour of having a model that is really good at predicting when something is not a hotdog, versus wanting a model that is really good at predicting when something is a hotdog.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have someone who doesn't really like hot dogs that much. We would prefer a model that probably outputs more consistently or classifies non-hot dog places as non-hot dog places where this default probably like opens up possibilities for someone looking for options that are likely not hot dog related. And it is not too terrible if hot dog place slides in given that it is the fewer of the bunch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that particular case, our model probably is the one fitting better into that narrative as it is consistent enough to determining or correctly classifying the null class even though if it's not as good as classifying the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in the context of someone really craving a hot dog and wanting to be very sure that that is a hot dog place, then probably the best model that we trained will not fit into that description as much, since it's not particularly good into predicting a class. For that case, it would have been better to train probably a decision tree, which we saw had much higher bias into identifying the hot dog class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A test accuracy of 0.71 shows that our model is still a work in progress, but it shows promising results from the confusion matrix, where it only has 1 FP. There are also 6 FN, as that is a byproduct of how the model learned the patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some challenges in the data set are the size. It is a small dataset with only ~90 entries. Another challenge is the imbalance of classes. It would be ideal if each class would represent roughly 50–50% of the samples. We believe that the imbalance was not severe, so we didn’t make any adjustments. In the future, we can take the argument “class_weight” into account during hyperparameter tuning for a model that supports it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we could also add for future iterations, or as a different research question, whether an SVM would perform better given the conditions we have mentioned. It is likely that a nonlinear model will likely fare better since we have found some instances where the natural bias of logistic regression and Naïve-Bayes have pushed the model to incorrectly classify some of the examples."
